# Creating custom endpoints for the AWS SDK for Rust<a name="endpoints"></a>

This section describes how to create a custom endpoint\. In most cases you use the endpoint that is pre\-configured for a service\. However, in some cases you must create a custom endpoint to use some non\-standard services, or to access a service that the SDK does not yet directly support\.
