# Amazon RDS Data Service examples using SDK for Rust<a name="rust_rds-data_code_examples"></a>

The following code examples show you how to perform actions and implement common scenarios by using the AWS SDK for Rust with Amazon RDS Data Service\.

*Actions* are code excerpts that show you how to call individual Amazon RDS Data Service functions\.

*Scenarios* are code examples that show you how to accomplish a specific task by calling multiple Amazon RDS Data Service functions\.

Each example includes a link to GitHub, where you can find instructions on how to set up and run the code in context\.

**SDK for Rust**  
This documentation is for an SDK in preview release\. The SDK is subject to change and should not be used in production\.

```
async fn query_cluster(
    client: &Client,
    cluster_arn: &str,
    query: &str,
    secret_arn: &str,
) -> Result<(), Error> {
    let st = client
        .execute_statement()
        .resource_arn(cluster_arn)
        .database("postgres") // Do not confuse this with db instance name
        .sql(query)
        .secret_arn(secret_arn);

    let result = st.send().await?;

    println!("{:?}", result);
    println!();

    Ok(())
