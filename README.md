## Developer guide for the AWS SDK for Rust

This repository contains the open source version of the official AWS SDK for Rust Developer Guide.
It provides information about how to set up and use the AWS SDK for Rust to create Rust applications that use AWS.

The GitHub repository for the AWS SDK for Rust is at https://github.com/awslabs/aws-sdk-rust.

## âš  Important

The Rust SDK is currently in alpha development.
We strongly recommend that you do not use the Rust SDK in production,
as there will likely be breaking changes between now and the v1 release.

## Security

See [CONTRIBUTING](CONTRIBUTING.md#security-issue-notifications) for more information.

## Reporting issues

You can use the Issues section of this repository to report problems in the documentation. When submitting an issue, please indicate:

  * What page the issue occurs on; a URL or filename is best.
  * What the issue is, using as much detail as you can provide.
    * The issue might be simple. For example: "The page has a typo; the word 'complie' in the third paragraph should be 'compile'."
    * The issue might be more complex. If so, please describe it with enough detail so that it's clear to the AWS documentation team what the problem is.
