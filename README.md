## Developer guide for the AWS SDK for Rust

This repository contains the open source version of the official AWS SDK for Rust Developer Guide.
It provides information about how to set up and use the AWS SDK for Rust to create Rust applications that use AWS.

The GitHub repository for the AWS SDK for Rust is at https://github.com/awslabs/aws-sdk-rust.

## âš  Important

The Rust SDK is currently in developer preview.
We strongly recommend that you do not use the Rust SDK in production,
as there will likely be breaking changes between now and the v1 release.

## Important

- Running this code might result in charges to your AWS account.
- Running the tests might result in charges to your AWS account.
- We recommend that you grant this code least privilege,
  or at most the minimum permissions required to perform the task.
  For more information, see
  [Grant Least Privilege](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html#grant-least-privilege)
  in the AWS Identity and Access Management User Guide.
- This code has not been tested in all AWS Regions.
  Some AWS services are available only in specific
  [Regions](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regional-product-services).
